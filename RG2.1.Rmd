## WARNING!
This material is for the 2022 class, and has not been updated yet. This is not a final version!

## Notes
Note 1. This is the reading guide for Otto & Day Chapter 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

Note 2. Don't worry if you can't "derive the differential equation for exponential growth from the discrete-time recursion." (equation 3.4a).

## Overall reading advice

Tip 1. Consider a "three-pass" approach - read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paperâ€™s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

## Some questions to answer before class

1. Explain the following statement- *R*, the number of surviving individuals per parent, is constant regardless of population size, and invariable for all individuals in the population. Contrast this with *age-structured* models (like we discussed last week).

2. Explain the difference between *R* in the recursion equation for exponential growth and *r* in the differential equation. What does *per capita* mean? What value of *R* indicates the population size is not changing and what value of *r* indicates the population size is not changing?

3. How did the authors come up with the equation above Figure 3.3 directly from that figure? (Recall the formula for a line)

4. Be prepared to repeat what's written in the Box under equation 3.5b when I ask "what does the *logistic growth model assume about how population growth rate changes with increasing population size?"

5. Explain the difference between a linear and non-linear model of population growth (exponential and logistic), basically using what is written in the box under Figure 3.4, and using equations 3.5b and 3.2 to illustrate this difference.
