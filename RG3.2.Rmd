## Notes
Note 1. This will be the reading guide for Lehaye et al. 1994.

## Some questions to answer before class

1. What is the overall goal of this analysis and study - what critical question are the researchers addressing that makes the study, data, and models useful?

2. Owls can fly, which in theory means in a landscape you can find them anywhere. ![Landscape is continuous](./media/landscape1.jpg){width="25%"} Yet, the researchers apply *metapopulation* theory, which assumes the species occupies a patchy landscape.
![Landscape is patchy](./media/landscape2.jpg){width="25%"}
Why is owl habitat patchy and not continuous?

3. What is the estimated carrying capacity of the San Bernadino (SBM) and San Jacinto (SJM) mountain spotted owl population? (hint: see Figure 1)

4. The researchers estimated a population growth rate *r* = 0.86 for the SBM population- please find where in the text this result is given.

5. Can you explain why increased correlation in sensitivity to environmental variation among spotted owl populations can place the entire metapopulation at increased risk of extinction (1st paragraph on page 778)?

6. Can you explain why the formula on page 778:

$$ N_i(t+1) = N_i(t)R_i(t) - \sum_{j=1}^{n} m_{ij}N_i + \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{ji}N_j$$

represents a metapopulation model? Please include a definition for metapopulation, with a citation (using [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) (perhaps [Hanski & Gilpin 1991](./media/Hanski_Gilpin_1991.pdf)).

```{r}
# Extra code to simulate normal and log-normal for SBM population
n <- density(rnorm(1000,0.86,0.11))
ns <- n$y / max(n$y)
plot(n$x,ns,type="l",col="skyblue",ylab="probability",xlab="R",lwd=3)

mu <- 0.86
sd <- 0.11
mu_l <- log(mu^2 / (sqrt(mu^2 + sd^2)))
sd_l <- log(1 + (mu^2 + sd^2))
n <- density(rlnorm(1000,mu_l,sd_l))
ns <- n$y / max(n$y)
plot(n$x,ns,type="l",col="skyblue",ylab="probability",xlab="R",lwd=3,xlim=c(-1,3))
```


7. The authors believe there is evidence that (i) population locations are correlated in the amount of total annual rainfall and (ii) that this environmental property impacts fecundity. Please explain their analysis to justify this.

8. Please look carefully at Figure 9 - what is on the x- and y-axis? How do they support this statement: a correlation in response of populations to rainfall makes spotted owls *more likely* to become extinct.

9. Compare Figure 9 to Figure 8 - is metapopulation structure important to understand Spotted owl extinction risk?
