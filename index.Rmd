# Course Information

This is a seminar course, held from 16-17h on Wednesdays and 16-18h on Thursdays, in room S05 R03 H8. The grade in the course will stem from 2 projects. Project 1 will be creating a "cheat sheet", or a 1-2 page document that provides an overview of a theoretical model in Ecology or Limnology. Project 2 will be a hands-on application, where you will take actual data and test predictions from theoretical models.

# Course Description

In this course, we have three main goals: (1) we will learn the basics of how to construct, read, intuit, and deconstruct models, (
(2) we will get an overview of models that are often used in Ecology, Evolution, and Aquatic Biology, and (3) we will learn statistical tools to fit actual, observed data to theoretical models. We will gain proficiency in computational ecology, as we will use the statistical programming language R to work with models and data. The classroom is equipped with computer workstations.
