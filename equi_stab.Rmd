1. Resource 1: PDF of Otto & Day *A Biologist's Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution* (Sarah P. Otto & Troy Day, 2007) - [__Chapter 5, Equilibria and Stability Analyses - One Variable Models__](./media/OttoDay_Ch5.pdf) - **note: 50 pages, mostly about discrete-time models. Not easy.**

2. Resource 2: Otto & Day Chapter 8 - [__Chapter 8, Equilibria and Stability Analyses - Nonlinear Models with Multiple Variables__](./media/OttoDay_Ch8.pdf) - **note: 30 pages, does include predator-prey models. Sadly not Lotka-Volterra competition**

3. Description of phase plane analysis and diagrams in general for one- and two-variable equations Linked [here](https://hluebbering.github.io/phase-planes/)
